# Logic Gate Simulator

![Logic Gate Simulator Screenshot](screenshot.png)

A modern, interactive web application for learning about and simulating basic logic gates. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

- **Interactive Gate Explorer**: Visual representations and truth tables for all basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR)
- **Gate Calculator**: Simulate gate operations with customizable inputs
- **Educational Content**: Learn about how logic gates work and their applications
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface built with Tailwind CSS

## How to Use

1. **Explore Gates**:
   - Navigate to the "Basic Logic Gates" section
   - View each gate's symbol, description, and truth table

2. **Use the Calculator**:
   - Select input values (0 or 1) for A and B
   - Choose a gate type from the dropdown
   - Click "Calculate" to see the result
   - The output will display along with the selected gate's icon

3. **Learn About Logic Gates**:
   - Read the "About Logic Gates" section for background information
   - Discover real-world applications of logic gates

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for accessibility
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks or libraries needed
- **SVG Icons**: Custom gate representations

## Installation

No installation required! This is a static website that can be run directly in any modern web browser:

1. Download the `index.html` file
2. Open it in your preferred web browser

Alternatively, you can host it on any static web hosting service like:
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Firebase Hosting

## Customization

To modify the application:

1. Edit the `index.html` file:
   - Change colors in the Tailwind config section
   - Add new gates by following the existing card pattern
   - Modify the calculator logic in the JavaScript section

2. The application uses Tailwind CSS via CDN, so no build step is required.
